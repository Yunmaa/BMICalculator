# BMI Calculator
This Jupyter Notebook contains a simple Python program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input of their weight and height. The program prompts the user to enter their name, weight in pounds, and height in inches, and then calculates and displays their BMI along with a corresponding weight status category.

3. Run the program by clicking on the "Run" button in the toolbar or using the "Shift+Enter" keyboard shortcut.
4. Enter your name, weight in pounds, and height in inches when prompted.

Note: If the user enters invalid inputs, the program will prompt them to enter valid inputs.
